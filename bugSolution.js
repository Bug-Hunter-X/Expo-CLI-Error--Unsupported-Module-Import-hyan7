To fix this, you have two primary options:

1. **Find an Expo alternative:** Search for an Expo-compatible module that provides similar functionality. Many popular Node.js packages have Expo equivalents available through Expo's ecosystem. 

2. **Eject to bare workflow:** If no Expo alternative exists and you need the specific functionality, consider ejecting from the managed workflow to a bare React Native project. This gives you full access to all Node.js modules but requires more manual configuration and maintenance.

**Example:**

Let's say you need cryptographic functionality. Instead of `crypto`, you might use the `expo-crypto` library (if it exists or a suitable alternative). Replace:
```javascript
import crypto from 'crypto';
// ... code using crypto ...
```
With (after installing `expo-crypto`):
```javascript
import * as Crypto from 'expo-crypto';
// ... code using Crypto ...
```
Remember to install the necessary package using:
`expo install expo-crypto` (or the appropriate package name)
