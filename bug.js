This error typically occurs when you try to import a module that Expo doesn't support or doesn't have a direct equivalent.  Expo's managed workflow has limitations compared to bare React Native.  The specific error message will indicate the problematic module.

For example, if you try to import `crypto` which is a Node.js module:
```javascript
import crypto from 'crypto';
```
Expo will throw an error because `crypto` is not available in the Expo managed workflow.
